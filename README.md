<p align="center">This project aims to improve the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the prediction of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) to AD conversion by comparing the efficiency of four post-hoc harmonisation techniques on a cohort of 1358 participants. We use neuroimaging data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset, and build two classifiers using cortical thickness data.

## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

Write about 1-2 paragraphs describing the purpose of your project.

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.

## 🔧 Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system.

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
